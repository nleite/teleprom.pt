00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,740
Greetings, my name
is Grigori Melnik.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,620
I'm the head of product
for server and tools,

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,210
including Compass, our
intuitive GUI from MongoDB.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,640
Many of you are already
familiar with Compass.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,590
But for those who
are not, I encourage

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,480
you to download it
right away, and see

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,760
how it can help you explore
and manipulate the data,

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,380
as well as to build powerful
queries, including Geo queries.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,850
Seriously, pause right now,
go to MongoDB Download Center,

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,040
and grab the latest
version of Compass.

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,490
See the notes below for a
link to the Download Center.

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,830
Compass is packed
with useful features

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,040
to help you be even more
productive with MongoDB.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,750
Through the schema
visualizer, you

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,390
can understand the
frequency, types, and ranges

17
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,310
of fields in your data set.

18
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,700
Compass also offers you a view
into key server performance

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,950
metrics so you can
easily understand

20
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,340
your most active collections.

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,620
With visual explained
plans, you can

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,200
investigate how
queries are running

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,320
and resolve performance issues.

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,310
You can also view and create
document validation rules

25
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,160
as well as perform a
rudimentary index management,

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,800
reviewing the types and
size of your indices,

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,980
their utilization, and being
able to add or remove indices

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,050
at the click of a button.

29
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,290
In the past six months, the team
has introduced several highly

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,150
anticipated features.

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,540
Here are the highlights.

32
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,340
First stop is the
aggregation pipeline builder.

33
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,430
The aggregation framework is
one of the most powerful MongoDB

34
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,650
tools at your disposal.

35
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,650
Built on the concept of
data process and pipelines,

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,800
like Unix or in PowerShell,
the aggregation framework

37
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,840
lets users funnel
their documents

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,800
through a multi-stage pipeline
that filters, transforms,

39
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,466
sorts, computes, aggregates
your data, and more.

40
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:45,840
The aggregation
framework enables

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,060
you to perform
extensive analytics

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,370
and statistical
analysis in real time

43
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,390
and generate pre-aggregated
reports for dashboard.

44
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,970
To help you be even more
successful with the aggregation

45
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,200
framework, we've decided to
build a user interface for it.

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,490
And that's what the aggregation
pipeline builder is.

47
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,850
With its intuitive drag and drop
experience and code skeletons,

48
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,720
there is no need to worry about
bracket matching, reordering

49
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,080
stages, or remembering
operator syntax.

50
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,630
And of course, you also
get auto completion

51
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,960
for aggregation operators,
query operators, and even

52
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,270
document field names.

53
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,100
If you're authoring
your pipeline,

54
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,380
you can easily
preview the results.

55
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,150
This, in combination with the
ability to rearrange and toggle

56
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,470
stages on and off, make it easy
to troubleshoot your pipeline.

57
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,210
When you are satisfied
with the results,

58
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,980
the constructed
pipeline can be copied

59
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,990
into the clipboard for easy
pasting into your code,

60
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,910
or simply saved in your
favorites list for reuse later.

61
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,450
Also, we have added an ability
to import and export data

62
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,950
to and from your collections
in JSON or CSV formats.

63
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,290
This has been one of the
most consistently requested

64
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,530
features, and we're very happy
to deliver it in this release.

65
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,220
You're welcome.

66
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,270
Additionally, we have
refactored the Connect

67
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:10,632
dialog, making it more robust
and supporting the SRV records.

68
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:12,090
There are two
additional highlights

69
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,650
that I should also mention.

70
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,550
The first is the new
expert to language function

71
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,210
we've included in Compass.

72
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,630
This provides the
ability to convert

73
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,890
your queries and
aggregation pipelines

74
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,500
into Compass, to
the code in drivers

75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,600
language of your choice.

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,070
Initially JavaScript, Java,
Python, and C#, are supported.

77
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,690
But you can expect
us to roll out

78
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,120
other languages pretty soon.

79
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,540
The second is that we have also
introduced two new editions

80
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,760
of Compass, the Isolated edition
and the Read-only the edition.

81
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,650
The isolated edition targets
regulated industries.

82
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,280
It restricts network requests
to TLS-encrypted TCP connections

83
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,160
to the server chosen
on the Connect screen.

84
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,110
All other outbound
connections are not

85
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,580
permitted in this edition.

86
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,690
So it doesn't pull
any automatic updates,

87
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,890
it doesn't send any telemetry,
or crash report into MongoDB.

88
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,120
Map rendering in the schema
view is also unavailable.

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,070
And you won't be able
to take advantage

90
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,760
of the in-product
live support system.

91
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,150
The read-only the version
limits certain CRUD operations

92
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,810
within your organization.

93
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,279
Users are limited strictly
to read operations.

94
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,740
All other functionality
remains pretty much the same

95
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,860
as in the standard
MongoDB Compass.

96
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,910
We thrive on your feedback.

97
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,720
Compass release cadence
is every two weeks.

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,780
And I'd like to encourage you to
send us your feedback, and not

99
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,930
only with issues and screams,
but also kudos and success

100
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,400
stories.

101
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,650
Also, don't forget
about the Plug-in

102
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,200
API we've exposed last year.

103
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,690
Build your extensions
and plugins for Compass

104
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,300
and share them with the
rest of the community.

105
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,770
Send us the links
to your plugins,

106
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,130
and we'll profile them on
the community plugin page.

107
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,300
And there you have it.

108
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,090
We're expanding the
capabilities of MongoDB Compass

109
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,620
to make you even
more productive.

110
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,620
Next in this module,
you will learn

111
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,460
how Compass is evolving from
the data exploration tool

112
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,600
to more IDE-like authoring tool.

113
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,420
You'll learn how
it can assist you

114
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,050
in building and troubleshooting
powerful aggregations.

115
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,250
Happy aggregating.

116
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,130
Happy coding.
