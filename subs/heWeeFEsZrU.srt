1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499


2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,230
Now that we've welcomed you to
the course, let's talk shop.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,500
Let's go through the
logistics necessary for

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,300
your successful M040 journey.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,640
In this course, you'll
find a set of lectures.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,260
In each lecture,
you'll find a quiz

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,480
to test your understanding
of the [? exposed ?] topic

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,560
or feature.

9
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,570
The quizzes are not graded.

10
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,200
We will not be accounting
for that in your final course

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,360
grade.

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,920
In each chapter, aside
from the lecture,

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,000
you will find labs and homework.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,690
By the way, we use those
terms interchangeably.

15
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,810
These are graded and count
towards your final grade.

16
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,240
And finally, we
have the final exam,

17
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,120
where we are going to go
through a set of exercises,

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,180
exam-like questions, that will
count towards your final grade.

19
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,850
The specifics of
the grading policy

20
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,370
are described in this
video lecture notes.

21
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,520
To help you out throughout
the lecture videos and labs,

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,830
we will provide you handout
materials and lecture

23
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,360
notes that will
contain all commands

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,630
and environmental variables
used in the videos.

25
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,360
As part of those
handouts, we provide

26
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,690
a Vagrant virtual machine with
all the necessary requirements

27
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,360
and dependencies installed
so you can follow along

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,390
with the demonstrations
and lab exercises.

29
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,330
The virtual environment is
here for your convenience.

30
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,790
It helps us standardize
a learning environment

31
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,090
and allow you to have a clean
environment to play with.

32
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,490
We recommend you use
that for all labs.

33
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,290
However, that is not mandatory.

34
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,180
If you wish to install
all the material

35
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,340
in your own environment,
that's totally fine, as well.

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,720
But remember, there might be
some external dependencies

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,970
you will have to
have installed to be

38
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,330
able to follow through
the labs and the lectures.

39
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,860
At the end of this
course, you will

40
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,520
be able to download a completion
certificate so that you

41
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,110
can brag about it with
your friends and family,

42
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,540
which is great.

43
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,490
With all that said, buckle
up, and enjoy the course.
